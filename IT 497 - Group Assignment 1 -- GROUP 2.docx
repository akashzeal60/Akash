	A service which let you share documents, codes, photos, videos and any form of data in a secured way is termed as Online Sharing of data. This is an incentive to both the user and the service provider, as providers do not have to manage and support the data themselves and the users can access the data anywhere with any device such as Home Pc, Tablet, mobile etc. Below a report enlightening on various contemporary applications for file sharing

Google Drive
Google Drive is an online file storage service initiated by Google for users to save their important data online. Google provides 15 GB of free space to each user to store their data. This storage capacity can be increased by purchasing the subscription packages.
The main advantage of Google Drive is that it can store any file of any format. There is no limitation in the type or the format of the file. For and individual assignment, one might face any limitation in information sharing with the professor or any other person. During such a case, Google Drive is a very useful way of sharing any information. Even many software files and executable files can be shared via Google Drive that might consume time searching over the internet. 
Basically, there are dependencies in the group project. All the work must be done on or before time so that the project gets completed on time. In Google Drive, one can create a folder where everyone can share their part of the work which will automatically be shared to all. This saves a lot of time compared to mailing all documents to each of the group members. Also there is a facility of multiple users editing. All the users sharing the file can edit the file and save it. However the amount of data edited will not be known to other users.
In the programming courses like JAVA, this application will be helpful in sharing the different types of codes and programs required to run and get required output. Google Drive has the built in feature of Google Apps Scripts which helps the user to write the code inside the document itself. The Google Drive supports Java, CSS, PHP,CPP, etc. types of files for sharing.
For a non-programming course, usually this Google Drive might be helpful in sharing of any important announcements or any important pieces of reference or study material which needs to reach all the students in the class. It's a very fast and easy way to export all the files to all the students with just one click.

Dropbox
Dropbox Inc. developed a service known as Dropbox which helps in file sharing, and carries all the documents, pictures, important folders with them. The founder Drew Houston in 2007 developed Dropbox for himself while studying in MIT, which lead him to share his development resulting in the most trusted file sharing softwares.
While preparing for some projects and presentations the students face so many problems of keeping their documents, well synchronized and up to date which creates some discrepancies in their projects. With the help of Dropbox, documents can be accessed whenever it is needed.
Most common problems arising nowadays are how to collaborate the work with others in the team. Dropbox fulfills this need by providing simple and ample amount of data sharing. The folders can be dragged and dropped easily, plus the changes can be read or seen instantly. A key factor in ateam projectis the management of work which certainly works well with Dropbox.
The gist of using file sharing services is using your own documents whenever and wherever. Now it can be used for programming courses as well. If there is a design of code and eventually there is a need of help from your team, which is currently not present. You can share the program in Dropboxand your team can view your problem, and tackle it as soon as possible. Team members can edit the program side by side, developing it further.
If there is a class of 20 and the professor wants to share the presentation topics he taught and he wants it to be discussed, Dropbox can be the solution. He can upload his presentation for all 20 students at once and further the discussions can be made through it.

Evernote
Evernote is a software package developed by Evernote Publications .It is a type of note taking software. A note may refer to a printed text, webpage, photographs, hand written notes or voiced messages. These notes can be organized in a folder, edited, tagged, commented and searched.
To get started, a user requires an account. One can store their notes using a local machine and access them from any machine. Evernote is also compatible with different types of operating systems which allow users to access Evernotes by laptops, tablets, mobile phones, etc. A user who is working on an individual assignment can save and update his/her notes anytime from anywhere. Also he/she will be able to add notes and comments for his/her references. Students, researches, teachers and anyone can use Evernote to manage their work individually.
In a group project, team members can create a single Evernote account which is accessible by the whole team. In this way, the notes made by one member can be accessed and edited by the other member of the team. The Comments and Tags feature can be used to give reviews about the other memberâ€™s work.
Generally in a programming project several code files are created and managed by a group of programmers where each programmer works on an individual module of the program. Each of the programmers can then share his/her work with other programmers who also have Evernote accounts.
Evernote can also be of a great help for non-programming assignments such as research work and data analysis. An individual or a group of users can create a single or multiple Evernote account and then can use the facility provided by Evernote to access edit, tag, comment and share this work with the other users.

GIT HUB
Have you ever thought of Collaborative Coding or an Open source Coding environment where you can manage your project sitting around anywhere in the world? If so then Github is the answer. Github is an application/web service which offers many valuable features from file sharing to code review that gives developers a whole new simplified world of code sharing. 
Github is user friendly. Many people can work on the same document simultaneously without merging their updates. Basic work flow has four main steps. First SET UP A GIT means creating an account that can be managed privately and publicly. Secondly CREATING A REPOSITORY, which is like a workspace where users can share their codes and teams, can work on it. Third, FORK REPOSITORIES where one can create a new project from the existing project, and finally BE SOCIAL, that allows teams to discuss and follow.
Depending upon the project types, this application has various advantages as it may be able to understand 200 programming languages. In a group project, managing team and sharing docs is a cumbersome process but ACMEINC is an important feature of GIT HUB that makes it easier and simpler. One can give his/her  team a controlled access like RO, RW both an admin level access which allows users to differentiate the roles. Also for an individual project this application is very useful as it enable the user to choose the level of privacy and also provides great features such as Pull Request by which an user can discuss and manage issues in live conversations. 
Primarily GIT HUB is for Programming projects where Developers can share and build new codes. Also able to debug and using many GIT shell functions & programs. Also in a non-programming project one can share their documents like tutorials and files which can be viewed and edited by others. It is widely used by teachers, writers, students and many other professionals.

Ubuntu One
Ubuntu one is an online cloud based file storage and syncing application. The uses of this tool are almost similar to the other file sharing cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive. One feature that separates this tool from others is that the user can stream audio files from any mobile device running Android or IOS by saving them on Ubuntu One servers. 
This tool is particularly useful when the sole objective is to share a file of any format like text, image, audio or a PDF document, which will not be subjected to frequent changes. Ubuntu One is not of great help if all the users who have access to the file start modifying the file and replacing the current version with the latest version. So, this tool fits the bill for those who are working on individual assignments much better than those who are working in a group. It is much safer to use these tools to store the reports or documents rather than storing them on personal computers which are prone to physical damage or OS crashing leading to the loss of the files. Also, storing the files on Ubuntu One give the user access to his/her files through any mobile device.
This tool may not suit file sharing for group assignments, since there is no way to track the changes done to the files hosted using this tool. Microsoft SharePoint is the industry standard tool for these kinds of sharing purposes.
Ubuntu One can be used for group assignments but the group should agree upon a mechanism to track the changes done by the each individual member since it is not built into Ubuntu One. Ubuntu One cannot be used for programming courses since the programming courses require a sophisticated version control system. Github is a better tool for programming courses than Google Drive, SkyDrive or Dropbox. Github offers a mechanism to track the changes done by each user and it also provides a mechanism to reinstate the working version of the system in case of any inconsistency.

Conclusion:
All of the above tools provide a common facility of file sharing. These tools make it easier to work individually or in a group on a programming or a non programming assignment. These tools provide data storage to store file of different formats. Google Drive, Dropbox and Evernote are specifically used for sharing text documents whereas Github and Ubuntu One are specifically used for code files.
